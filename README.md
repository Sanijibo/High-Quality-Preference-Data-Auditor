# HighQuality-PreferenceData-Auditor

**Independent AI Research: Sani Jibo**

## Project Overview
This repository focuses on **Data-Centric AI** methods for auditing and validating Human Preference Data (HPD). The core alignment challenge is not just the algorithm (DPO/RLHF) but the quality, consistency, and stability of the preference data used for training.

This work demonstrates methods to identify and mitigate:
1. **Preference Inconsistencies** (conflicting human labels).
2. **Latent Preference Bias** (systematic flaws in the collection process).
3. **Data Drift** over time, ensuring the training set remains relevant.

### Key Features
* **Preference Inconsistency Score:** Conceptual script to quantify conflicting labels in an HPD file.
* **Bias Detection Hooks:** Scaffolding for identifying demographic or domain-specific biases in human feedback.
* **Data Quality Metrics:** Methods for calculating the "trustworthiness score" of a preference dataset.

## Alignment Mission
The quality of the input data is the bottleneck for scalable, safe, and cost-efficient LLM alignment. This project closes the loop between data collection and algorithmic stability.
